## Adapta Evergreen Rice

This theme was made with an intention to complement my linux rice **[Adapta Evergreen Rice](https://github.com/sagar-alias-jacky/Adapta_Evergreen_Rice)** for KDE. Feel free to check it out if you are interested :)

## Override this theme (Customization)

To override this (or any other) theme in your personal config file, please follow the guide in the **[color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme)** documentation. This is handy for small tweaks to the theme without having to fork and maintain your own theme.
